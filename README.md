## What Was The Challenge?

Create a program that takes any number between 1 - 9999 and converts it into the corresponding number in plain english.

## How I Expected The Challenge To Go...

I was confident that I could use the logic covered over the past week to write a solution to this problem.

## What Went Well...

I was able to think about the project logically, write it out and turn that into code that works!

## What Didn't Go As Planned...

To begin with, I started to approach the task in a way that was making it more difficult than it needed to be. I stopped, went back to thinking only about the logic, and everything clicked back into place.

## Improvements For Future Challenges

It would have been nice to have a little more of a stretch challenge for people who complete the main task quickly.
